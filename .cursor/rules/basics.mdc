This project is written in Rust, it uses Bevy engine.

This project is a game. Tower defense genre.

Because this is a typical Rust project please run `cargo check` at the end of your work to make sure all of the changes are ready to be tested.

Use ripgrep (rg) (ask user to install it if missing) to make your life easier when searching for things.

Utilize mise (ask user to install if missing), mise provides the correct environment, has useful tasks in its config.

Run `cargo fmt` (or identical mise task) to format your code before commiting. Setup pre-commit hook if needed.

When writing the game features keep in mind that we want this game to build on all three platforms: Windows, Linux, Macos.
