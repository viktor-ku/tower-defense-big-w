description: Basic rules to be always applied
alwaysApply: true
---

- This project is written in Rust, it uses Bevy engine

- It is a game. Tower defense genre

- Please run `cargo test` followed by `cargo check` at the end of your work to make 
    sure all of the changes are ready to be tested

- Use ripgrep (rg) to make your life easier when searching for things

- Utilize `mise(.exe)` - it provides the correct environment, has useful tasks in its config

- Run `cargo fmt` to format your code before commiting

- When writing the game features keep in mind that we want this game to build on 
    all three platforms: Windows, Linux, Macos

- Prefer to import/export concrete things instead of using `*` (star)

- Respect the splash screen: it should always load first without interruptions. While it's showed the main
    chunk of the game should be loaded. After that we should let the player play the game.
