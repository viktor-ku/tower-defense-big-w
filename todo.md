## Solid Next Moves

- Enemy waves: Wave count, intermission timer, difficulty scaling.
- Tower variety: Add AoE/slow/long-range towers + simple upgrade path.
- Enemy health bars: Small floating bars; fade when full/out of combat.
- Hit effects: Impact VFX, damage numbers, light screen shake on hits.
- Path highlights: Subtle spline/path preview for enemies or tower range circles.
- HUD polish: Icons for wood/rock, align/scale cleanly, pause menu.
- Save/load: Minimal save of player inventory, towers, and wave index.

Suggested starting focus: hold progress UI + tower costs.
